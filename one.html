    <img align="right" src="cafeimage.png" alt="hello" height="400" weight="400" />
    <p style = "font-size:26px">La café masion loosely translates to the coffee house. At La café mosion we celebrate our roots, a chance to showcase our cuisines that influenced our culinary landscape and to show off our northern bounty. Having worked in this field for more than 5 years, when I opened the café, I had the goal of creating a place where the staff and I would both enjoy going to work. where every viewpoint was respected, and no suggestion was ever ignored.  I wanted the workers to feel like family and the clients to enjoy a home away from home. I fell in love with the community and the location, and I hope that everyone that walks through the doors feels the passion that my family and my staff have for this business.</p>

<h2 style ="padding-left: 0px;"id="section3"><b>Sustainability</b></h2>
    <img align="right" src="solarpanel.png" alt="hello" height="400" weight="400" />
    <p style=" font-size: 26px;">Since protecting the environment is so important, we have made it our duty to include environmentally friendly procedures in all our daily operations. In order to reduce transportation emissions and aid regional farmers, we buy our foods as locally as feasible and whenever organic options are available. We employ packaging made of biodegradable or compostable materials to cut down on the use of single-use plastics and landfill space. Additionally, we encourage the usage of reusable containers and give discounts to clients who bring their own cups. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In order to capture renewable energy sources, we have also installed solar panels and purchased energy-efficient lighting and equipment. In addition, we've included green spaces, such interior plants and outdoor seating places, to make our clients feel calm and refreshed while also purifying the air. 
      <br>
      <br>
      We accept responsibility for minimizing the impact of our actions on the environment since we are aware of this influence. In order to ensure that garbage is disposed of correctly, we have developed composting and recycling facilities, and we encourage our clients to use them properly. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In our cafe, we consider being environmentally conscious to be more than just a trend. We are dedicated to enhancing our procedures on a constant basis and giving back to the environment and our local community. We appreciate you choosing our café and supporting our dedication to sustainability.</p>
